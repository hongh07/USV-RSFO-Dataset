# USV-RSFO-Dataset
The USV- RSFO dataset comprises eight categories of river surface floating objects: Bottle, Plastic bag, Foam board, Leaf, Branch, Boat, Others (unclassifiable monolithic garbage), and Mixed garbage. 

## Dataset source
The dataset collected from the river section of Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, China.

## Folder Structure

- **JPEGImages**: Contains all the image files. These images will be used as input data for model training and validation.

- **Annotations**: Contains the annotation files in YOLO format corresponding to the images. These annotation files provide object location and category information for each image, which is essential for object detection tasks.
# PSP-YOLOv8s
This project presents PSP-YOLOv8s,  to enhance accuracy and reliability in detecting small floating objects in complex river environments and contribute to more effective water protection using USVs.
